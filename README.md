===================

Detects interesting behavior based on collected data, including anomalies.  Also handles creating handlers in Sensu.


Some ideas here:
o Add module framework to create various behavior detection models including 3-sigma, simple robust outliers, etc.
o Add glue to translate anomaly detection to some sort of handler within Sensu, such a managing Flapjack as a notify/gateway component
